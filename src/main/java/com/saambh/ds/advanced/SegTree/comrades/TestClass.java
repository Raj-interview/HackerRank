/**
 * Created by aman.jamwal on 22/07/16.
 *
 * Itâ€™s the year 2552, the Humans just won a war against a very powerful alien race that had invaded
 * our solar system. The Human army is in celebration mode!
 *
 * The army has n soldiers. The soldiers are numbers from 1 to n. The army has a superiority
 * hierarchy. Every soldier has one immediate superior. The superior of a superior of a soldier is
 * also a superior to that soldier. So, a soldier may have one or more superiors but only one
 * immediate superior.
 *
 * Every soldier has to congratulate every other soldier. For a pair of soldiers if one of them is
 * the superior of the other, they will shake hands. Otherwise, they will bump their fists.
 *
 * You are given the list of immediate superior of all soldiers. Your job is to tell how many
 * handshakes and fist bumps will be there.
 *
 * NOTE: Among all soldiers there is one soldier who does not have any superior. He is the commander
 * of the whole army.
 *
 * Input:
 *
 * The first line of the input contains t, the number of test cases.
 *
 * The first line of each test case contains n, the number of soldiers. The next line contains n
 * space separated integers. The ith integer represents the immediate superior of the ith soldier.
 *
 * The immediate superior of the commander of the army will be '0'.
 *
 * Output:
 *
 * Output two space separated integers, the number of handshakes and the number of fist bumps.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1<=t<=10
 *
 * 1<=n<=100000
 *
 * It is guaranteed that the commander of the army is a superior of all soldiers.
 *
 * SAMPLE INPUT 2 3 0 1 1 2 2 0 SAMPLE OUTPUT 2 1 1 0 Explanation 1st test case: Handshakes between
 * (1,2), (1,3). Fist bumps between (2,3)
 *
 * 2nd test case: Handshake between (1,2) No fist bumps
